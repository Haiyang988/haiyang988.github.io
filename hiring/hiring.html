	<p class="content mobile-padding">
Who’s Hiring is a job-seeking app designed for people who are looking for a job in the service sector in urban area. The most distinctive feature of this app is that all recruitment promotions are assigned with a 24-hour count-down, which keeps all visible promotions fresh. It results in faster response time between jobseekers and employers.<br><br>

Furthermore, job seekers can make their resumes go public. As a result, they will be contacted by potential employers if their profiles are positively reviewed.

	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">The  Competition … and the Problem</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">
The market is never in storage of casual / part-time job-seeking apps in China. Just to name a few, there are Direct Store Manager Recruitment（店长直聘）, Doumi （斗米兼职）, Xiaomei Job（小美工作）,  Jianzhi Cat（兼职猫）, and 58 Casual Job（58兼职）, and so many more. Although they may have their own strength, they all follow the same template —— competing on the dimension of quantity. <br><br>

Quantity is nonetheless a crucial “feature” when it comes to job-seeking. However, during our user research, we find something else that could potentially make a breakthrough.<br><br>

The majority of job-seekers complained about “fake recruitments”.  They apply for a job, send their resumes, and there is a high change that in 7 applications out 10, they would never receive a reply. During our interview with the store managers, we learnt that store mangers are usually very busy, chances are they are unlikely to change their recruitment status from whichever app they are using even after they have recruited the right person. They simply abandon it.<br><br>

As for store mangers, they are complaining about a similar situation. Since most apps provide a switch for job-seekers to make their resumes visible to potential hirers, they seldom switch that off after they have found a job. So, store managers with urgent need can contact a person who doesn’t need a job at that moment. It’s time-consuming and disappointing. This is especially true when some apps monetize on the quantity of resumes.
