	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">Find the Right Job in 24 Hours</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">
Who’s Hiring is a job-seeking app designed for people who are looking for a job in the service sector in urban area. The most distinctive feature of this app is that all recruitment promotions are assigned with a 24-hour count-down, which keeps all visible promotions fresh. It results in faster response time between jobseekers and employers.<br><br>

Furthermore, job seekers can make their resumes go public. As a result, they will be contacted by potential employers if their profiles are positively reviewed.
	</p>


	<div class="image-container"><img class="image" src="images/hero_0.jpg"></div>
	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">The Competition and the Problem</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">
The market is never in storage of casual / part-time job-seeking apps in China. Just to name a few, there are Direct Store Manager Recruitment（店长直聘）, Doumi （斗米兼职）, Xiaomei Job（小美工作）,  Jianzhi Cat（兼职猫）, and 58 Casual Job（58兼职）, and so many more. Although they may have their own strength, they all follow the same template —— competing on the dimension of quantity. <br><br>

Quantity is nonetheless a crucial “feature” when it comes to job-seeking. However, during our user research, we find something else that could potentially make a breakthrough.<br><br>

The majority of job-seekers complained about “fake recruitments”.  They apply for a job, send their resumes, and there is a high change that in 7 applications out 10, they would never receive a reply. During our interview with the store managers, we learnt that store mangers are usually very busy, chances are they are unlikely to change their recruitment status from whichever app they are using even after they have recruited the right person. They simply abandon it.<br><br>

As for store mangers, they are complaining about a similar situation. Since most apps provide a switch for job-seekers to make their resumes visible to potential hirers, they seldom switch that off after they have found a job. So, store managers with urgent need can contact a person who doesn’t need a job at that moment. It’s time-consuming and disappointing. This is especially true when some apps monetize on the quantity of resumes.
	</p>

	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">The Value Proposition : Be Faster</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">

After we have learnt the complains from our users. We think can provide a better user experinece by eliminating the outdated posts to make the job-seeking hand hiring process more effective. In order to do that, we limit the visible time of both the recruitment posts and job-seekers’ resumes to 24 hours each. <br><br>

<strong>1. Why limit the time ?</strong><br><br>
It’s all for a faster and effective job-seeking / recruitment experience. Building a job-seeking platform is about mixing and matching the right parties. Most apps do this by examining the employers’ requirement and job-seekers’ qualifications such as desired location, salary, benefits, education, and working experience, etc. Urgency is often overlooked. By limiting the visible time, outdated post are automatically pulled off, thus only the most urgent parties get mixed and matched. The result is that Job-seekers don’t need to spend unnecessarily long time applying outdated recruitment. And Employers can also enjoys a higher chance of meaningful communication with job-seekers.<br><br>


<strong>2. Why 24 hours ?</strong><br><br>
As I have mentioned at the beginning, front-line job seeking and recruitment take far less time than office worker recruitment. When someone is looking for a store job or when a store needs an employee, they’re usually urgent. That’s why the time is limited to a considerably short time of 24 hours. When a post is pulled off after 24 hours, the store managers can re-activated it with a simple tap of a button. It’s the same case with Job-seekers.</p>	

	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">Monetization</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">The competitors monetize their service in a variety of ways. The most common one is selling “ Resume Packages “ to employers. It means that they can sell the same resume again and again to different buyers. To be frank, this is a smart way of making money. However, since not all resumes in the Packages are actually active, it won’t be long before the store managers find out that they are spending money on outdated information. Additionally, none of competitors charge the job-seekers.<br><br>

	As a startup, we need to find a sustainable business model. We can’t sell the cow for her milk. So we come up with one fair way of charging the store managers. Each recruiting account can post a recruitment free-of-charge. If a job-seeking applies this job, the store manager can inspect his or her resume and initiate a chat.<br><br>

If there’s no job-seekers applying the job. They store manager can buy a resume and contact the job-seeker proactively. Since all public resumes are activated within 24 hours. The store manager has a higher change of finding a “real” candidate in a short amount of time.</p>

	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">Risks</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">Although we aim to help the job-seekers find a job faster, we may fall from influencing enough store managers to invest into a new service. According to our own research, we find that when some stores lost one or two employees, they can still operate without too much of a problem. <br><br>

Our research also shows over 50% of stores are still using internal recommendation as their major approach of recruitment, which means that it’s only a supplement to recruit employees through a mobile app in these stores. They might not have strong motivation to pay for a third-party service.</p>
