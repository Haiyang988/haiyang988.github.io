	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding en hidden">A Brief Look at the Background</h2>
	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding cn">行业概览</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">
The market is never in shortage of casual / part-time job-seeking apps in China. Just to name a few, there are Direct Store Manager Recruitment（店长直聘）, Doumi （斗米兼职）, Xiaomei Job（小美工作）,  Jianzhi Cat（兼职猫）, and 58 Casual Job（58兼职）, and so many more. Although they may have their own strength, they all follow the same template —— competing on the dimension of quantity. </p>
	<div class="image-container"><img class="image" src="images/players.jpg"></div>
<p class="content mobile-padding">Quantity is nonetheless a crucial “feature” when it comes to job-seeking. However, during our user research, we find something else that could potentially make a breakthrough.<br><br>

The majority of job-seekers complained about “fake recruitments”.  They apply for a job, send their resumes, and there is a high change that in 7 applications out 10, they would never receive a reply. During our interview with the store managers, we learnt that store mangers are usually very busy, chances are they are unlikely to change their recruitment status from whichever app they are using even after they have recruited the right person. They simply abandon it.<br><br>

As for store mangers, they are complaining about a similar situation. Since most apps provide a switch for job-seekers to make their resumes visible to potential hirers, they seldom switch that off after they have found a job. So, store managers with urgent need can contact a person who doesn’t need a job at that moment. It’s time-consuming and disappointing. This is especially true when some apps monetize on the quantity of resumes.
	</p>

	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">The Value Proposition : On-Demand Job-seeking</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">

After we have learnt the complains from our users. We think we can provide a better user experience by eliminating the outdated posts to make the job-seeking and hiring process more effective. In order to do that, we limit the visible time of both the recruitment posts and job-seekers’ resumes to 24 hours each. It means that all the job openings a job-seeker sees are actually active. And all Resumes a store manager views are looking for a job at that particular moment. That’s the experience we want to bring to our users. <br><br></p>

<p class="content mobile-padding">


<strong>Why 24 Hours ?</strong><br><br>
Front-line job seeking and recruitment take far less time than office worker recruitment. This usually happens in a week on average. When someone is looking for a store job or when a store needs an employee, they won't wait for too long. That’s why we limit the time to a considerably short time of 24 hours. When a post is pulled off after 24 hours, the store managers can re-activated it with a simple tap of a button. It’s the same case with the job-seekers.</p>	
	<div class="image-container"><img class="image" src="images/24hour.jpg"></div>
	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">Monetization</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">The most common way of monetizing their services among our competitors is through selling “ Resume Packages “ to the store managers. It means that they can sell the same resume again and again to different buyers. To be frank, this's a smart way of making money. However, since not all resumes in the Packages are actually active, it won’t be long before the store managers find out that they are spending money on outdated information. Additionally, none of competitors charge the job-seekers.<br><br>

	As a startup, we need to find a sustainable business model. We can’t sell the cow for her milk. So we come up with one fair way of charging the store managers. Each recruiting account can post a recruitment free-of-charge. If a job-seeking applies this job, the store manager can inspect his or her resume and initiate a chat.<br><br>

If there’s no job-seekers applying the job. They store manager can buy a resume and contact the job-seeker proactively. Since all public resumes are activated within 24 hours. The store manager has a higher change of finding a “real” candidate in a short amount of time.</p>
	

	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">The User Journey</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">We designed both of the job-seeker’s and store manager’s journeys into one app. Their journeys resemble each other a lot. It's not hard to understand because they will interact closely with each other.</p>
	<div class="image-container"><img class="image" src="images/journey_of_jobseeker.jpg"></div>
	<div class="image-container"><img class="image" src="images/journey_sm.jpg"></div>

	

	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">Design</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">We choose black and yellow as the accent colors and light gray as the secondary color. Who’s Hiring is considered as a sequel of Gikoo Job which also uses yellow as the accent color, so we want to retain this connection by keeping the color. We also add black as an accent because we see the app as a pivot moment from Gikoo Job which have a stronger momentum of serving the brand’s headquarter in the backend logic, while the Store Manager’s opinions are often overlooked. With Who’s Hiring, we want to give the store managers more freedom when they’re recruiting their own staff.</p>

	<h2 class="content-title mobile-padding">Risks</h2>
	<p class="content mobile-padding">Although we aim to help the job-seekers find a job faster, we may fall from influencing enough store managers to invest into a new service. According to our own research, we find that when some stores lost one or two employees, they can still operate without too much of a problem. <br><br>

Our research also shows over 50% of a store are recruited using traditonal methods such as internal recommendation and window posters, which means that it’s a supplement to recruit employees through a mobile app in these stores today. They might not have strong motivation to pay for a third-party service.</p>
